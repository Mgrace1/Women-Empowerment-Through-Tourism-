            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>In recent decades, more women around the world have taken the opportunity to enter the market, join the workforce, and start their own entrepreneurial ventures. These changes have had a strong impact on market demographics. Particularly within the tourism industry, it is important to investigate the behavior, motivations, experiences, and needs of women as travelers, employees, and entrepreneurs. Women's Empowerment Within the Tourism Industry offers a conversant and comprehensive overview of the themes and concepts of women as tourists, employees, and entrepreneurs in tourism. Providing interdisciplinary insights from leading international researchers and academicians, this book makes a critical contribution to the knowledge of women's participation within the tourism industry. It discusses the nature of their work and ways in which tourism creates tension between the attitudes and conduct of tourists and the beliefs and behavior of local women. Covering topics such as consumer experience, gender studies, and women's employment, this premier reference source is an excellent resource for business leaders and managers, entrepreneurs, marketers, government officials, students and educators of higher education, librarians, researchers, and academicians.</p>
